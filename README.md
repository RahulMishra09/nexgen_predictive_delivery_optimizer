# NexGen Logistics ‚Äî Predictive Delivery Optimizer üì¶

Predict shipment delays **before they happen** using a tuned **Random Forest ensemble model** ‚Äî and take proactive actions to reduce delays, costs, and customer churn.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
Delivery delays lead to:
- üí∏ Penalties & operational losses
- üò† Customer dissatisfaction
- üîÅ Churn and missed revenue
- üìâ SLA violations

**We solve this by:**
- Predicting high-risk shipments
- Prescribing targeted operational actions
- Preventing avoidable delays

---

## üí° Solution Overview
‚úÖ **End-to-end ML workflow including:**
- Multi-source logistics data ingestion
- 30+ engineered features
- Tuned Random Forest delay classifier
- Probability-based risk scoring
- Actionable prescription engine
- Streamlit UI for user-friendly interaction

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Approach ‚Äî Random Forest Ensemble
This project uses a `RandomForestClassifier` optimized via `GridSearchCV`.

| Why Random Forest? | Benefit | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Bagging (Bootstrap sampling) | Lower variance, reduced overfitting |
| Random feature subset per split | Better generalization |
| Ensemble voting | Stability + accuracy |
| Probabilistic outputs | Risk-based prioritization |

**Final Tuned Model Example:**
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=None,
    min_samples_split=2,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    max_features='sqrt',
    random_state=42
)
```

    [Risk Scoring (probability 0-1)] ---> [Streamlit Dashboard]
                                 |
                                 v
    [Prescription Engine (rules & actions)] ---> [Streamlit Dashboard]
                                 |
                                 v
    [Business Impact & Reporting (costs, ROI, saved orders)]
```

Notes:
- The feature engine produces a stable set of features used by both training and inference.
- The prescription engine takes score + features as input and generates prioritized actions (carrier swap, reroute, priority upgrade, etc.).
- The Streamlit UI surfaces high-risk orders, recommended actions, and business impact metrics for operations teams.
