## 🎯 Problem Statement

In logistics, **delivery delays** cause:
- 💸 Lost revenue and penalty costs
- 😞 Poor customer experience (CSAT drop)
- 📉 Operational inefficiencies
- 🔄 Increased customer churn

Traditional reactive approaches **cannot prevent delays**. We need a **proactive, ML-powered system** to:
1. **Predict** which shipments are at risk
2. **Prescribe** actionable interventions (carrier swap, route optimization, etc.)
3. **Prevent** delays before they impact customers

---

The **Predictive Delivery Optimizer** uses:

### 📊 Data Engineering
- Multi-table data integration (orders, carriers, warehouses, fleet, tracking, costs)
- Schema validation and data quality checks
- Feature engineering pipeline with 30+ predictive features

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Delay risk scoring (0-100% probability)
- Real-time prediction on new orders

### 💊 Prescription Engine
- Rule-based action recommendations:
  - 🚚 Carrier swap
  - 🗺️ Route optimization
  - 🚗 Vehicle reassignment
  - ⚡ Priority upgrade
  - 🏭 Warehouse reroute
  - 📧 Proactive customer alerts

### 📈 Business Impact
- Monthly savings estimation
- ROI tracking
- Customer churn prevention metrics

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Data

Place your CSV files in the `data/` directory. Expected schema:

#### **orders.csv** (required)
```
order_id, customer_id, warehouse_id, carrier_id, vehicle_id, priority,
ship_date, promised_date, actual_delivery, distance_km, ...
```

#### **customers.csv**
```
customer_id, segment, region, lifetime_value, ...
```

#### **warehouses.csv**
```
warehouse_id, city, capacity, current_load, ...
```

#### **carriers.csv**
```
carrier_id, on_time_pct, coverage, emissions_g_per_km, ...
```

#### **fleet.csv**
```
vehicle_id, type, capacity, refrigeration, avg_speed_kmph, ...
```

#### **tracking.csv**
```
order_id, scan_time, status, location, delay_minutes, ...
```

#### **costs.csv**
```
order_id, linehaul_cost, last_mile_cost, surcharge, ...
```

**Note**: If your schema differs, update the column mappings in [src/data.py](src/data.py) and feature logic in [src/features.py](src/features.py).

### 3. Run Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The UI will open at `http://localhost:8501`

### 4. Workflow in UI

1. **Home** → Load/validate data
2. **Data Overview** → Explore datasets
3. **Model Training** → Engineer features & train ML model
4. **Predictions** → Generate risk scores for all orders
5. **Action Plan** → View recommended interventions
6. **Business Impact** → See ROI and savings estimates

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Business Assumptions

Edit [src/utils.py](src/utils.py) → `calculate_business_impact()`:

```python
avg_delay_cost = 500  # ₹ per delayed order
avg_order_value = 2000  # ₹
customer_churn_cost = 10000  # ₹ per churned customer
delay_churn_rate = 0.05  # 5% of delayed customers churn
```

### Add New Prescription Rules

Edit [src/rules.py](src/rules.py) → `PrescriptionEngine` class:

```python
def prescribe_custom_action(self, row: pd.Series) -> Dict:
    if row['your_condition']:
        return {
            'action': 'Your Action',
            'priority': 'High',
            'details': 'Description...',
            'estimated_impact': '10-15% improvement',
            'cost_impact': 'Low'
        }
    return None
```

Then add to `generate_prescriptions()` rules list.

### Modify Features

Edit [src/features.py](src/features.py) → `FeatureEngineer` methods to add custom features based on your domain knowledge.

## 🧪 Testing with Sample Data

If you don't have real data yet, generate synthetic data:

```python
# Create sample orders.csv
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

np.random.seed(42)
n_orders = 1000

orders = pd.DataFrame({
    'order_id': range(1, n_orders + 1),
    'customer_id': np.random.randint(1, 200, n_orders),
    'warehouse_id': np.random.randint(1, 10, n_orders),
    'carrier_id': np.random.randint(1, 15, n_orders),
    'vehicle_id': np.random.randint(1, 50, n_orders),
    'priority': np.random.choice(['Express', 'Standard', 'Economy'], n_orders),
    'ship_date': [datetime.now() - timedelta(days=np.random.randint(1, 30)) for _ in range(n_orders)],
    'distance_km': np.random.randint(10, 1500, n_orders),
})

orders['promised_date'] = orders['ship_date'] + timedelta(days=3)
orders['actual_delivery'] = orders['ship_date'] + timedelta(days=np.random.randint(2, 6))

orders.to_csv('data/orders.csv', index=False)
```

Repeat for other CSVs (customers, warehouses, etc.).
