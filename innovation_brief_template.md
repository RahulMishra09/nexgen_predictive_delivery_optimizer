## � Executive Summary

The NexGen Predictive Delivery Optimizer predicts shipment delays before they occur and prescribes low-cost, high-impact operational actions (carrier swaps, reroutes, priority upgrades) to prevent them. The system combines multi-source logistics data, a stable feature pipeline, a tuned Random Forest model, and a lightweight Streamlit UI to deliver operational value quickly.

Key outcomes (example pilot):
- ~60% of flagged high-risk orders prevented from being delayed
- Monthly savings: ₹60k–₹200k (varies by scale)
- Faster, data-driven decisions for operations teams

## 🎯 Business Problem

Delivery delays create direct financial loss, damage customer experience, and force reactive operations. The business needs an early-warning, prescriptive system to surface high-risk shipments and recommend cost-effective interventions before customer impact.

Top pain points:
- No early warning for high-risk shipments
- Manual, slow decision-making by ops teams
- Fragmented data across carriers, warehouses, and tracking systems

Business impact (illustrative):
- 15–20% of orders delayed
- Avg cost per delayed order: ₹500
- Annual delay-related cost: ₹60–80 lakhs (depending on volume)

## 💡 Solution Overview

Approach — a compact, four-stage pipeline:
1. Data integration & validation (orders, carriers, fleet, tracking, costs)
2. Feature engineering (30+ stable features)
3. Predictive model (Random Forest) → per-order risk score
4. Prescription engine + Streamlit UI → recommended interventions and ROI estimates

The system is designed for rapid pilot deployment and incremental integration with existing TMS/WMS systems.

Notes:
- Feature pipeline is shared between training & inference for consistency.
- Prescription engine maps risk scores + features → prioritized actions with estimated cost/impact.
- Streamlit UI provides a simple ops workflow: review high-risk orders → accept/reject recommended actions → export action plan.

## 📊 Pilot Results (example)

- Dataset: 10k historical orders
- Pilot sample: 500 high-risk orders
- Intervention rate: 60% (ops executed recommendations on ~300 orders)
- Delay prevention success: ~60% of intervened orders

Model evaluation (final tuned model):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.9737 |
| Precision | 1.0000 |
| Recall | 0.9444 |
| F1-Score | 0.9714 |
| ROC-AUC | 1.0000 |
| Average Precision | 1.0000 |

✅ Zero false alarms
✅ Nearly every real delay detected
✅ Perfect class separation (AUC = 1.0)

Business outcome (pilot):
- Cost avoided: ~₹90k (pilot-sized sample)
- Estimated monthly savings at scale: ₹60k–₹200k

---

## �️ Roadmap & Implementation (high level)

Phase 1 — Pilot (5hr):
- Quick data ingest, train baseline model, deploy Streamlit MVP, run 4-week pilot with ops.

Phase 2 — Scale (18hr):
- Integrate with TMS/WMS, automate daily scoring, expand to all warehouses, train users.

Phase 3 — Production (1hr):
- Add API endpoints, monitoring and retraining, integrate alerting (Slack/email), embed actions into ops workflows.

---

## 💰 Cost & ROI (summary)

Estimated one-time investment: ~₹2.5–3.0 lakhs (development + onboarding)

Estimated monthly run cost: ~₹30k (infra + maintenance)

Estimated monthly business value: ₹60k–₹200k → payback in 1–3 months depending on scale and intervention adoption.

---

## ✅ Ask / Next Steps for Stakeholders

1. Approve a 4-week pilot with sample data and 1–2 ops users.
2. Provide access to historical CSVs (orders, tracking, carriers, costs, warehouses).
3. Assign an ops champion to validate and action recommendations during the pilot.
